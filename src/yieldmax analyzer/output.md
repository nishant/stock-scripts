## Tightening the Criteria

Notice that not a single weekly ETF made the list. 
This suggests that weekly distributions are more volatile and less reliable indicators of sustained growth.
This doesn't mean they aren't worth buying, but they require a shorter-term focus.
The next table will be after tightening the criteria to shorter time spans.

## Potential Medium Risk Entry Points
If monthly: 2 months of increasing distributions
If weekly: 2 weeks of increasing distributions

While this is not a ton of data, hence the risk, it does indicate a trend that could be a good entry point.
